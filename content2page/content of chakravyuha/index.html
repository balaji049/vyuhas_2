          <p class="answer-text">
            Chakra Vyuha, or the "Wheel Formation," is one of the most sophisticated battle strategies used in ancient Indian warfare, particularly in the epic Mahabharata. The formation comprises multiple concentric circles of soldiers and chariots, designed to confuse and trap the enemy. 
            <br><br>
            Each circle has varying levels of defense, with outer rings composed of lighter forces to bait and slow down enemies. As an enemy penetrates the layers, they encounter progressively stronger defenders, leading to an almost impenetrable defense by the time they reach the core.

          <p class="answer-text">
            The breaking of the Chakra Vyuha is one of the most heroic yet tragic stories in the Mahabharata, primarily due to Abhimanyu's bravery. Abhimanyu, son of Arjuna, was aware of how to enter the Chakra Vyuha but did not know the full strategy for exiting. 
            <br><br>
            Despite his valor, he was outnumbered and ultimately killed, making his act one of the most poignant moments in the epic. After Abhimanyu's death, Arjuna and the Pandavas developed strategies to prevent further traps, striking in multiple places at once to disrupt the formation.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <img src="content of chakravyuha imgs/symbol of chakra vyuha.png" alt="Symbolism of Chakra Vyuha" class="faq-image">
          <p class="answer-text">
            The Chakra Vyuha represents much more than just a military formation; it reflects the cycles of life, death, and rebirth, as well as the balance between power and vulnerability. The outer rings symbolize the fragility of life, where any misstep can bring an end, while the inner core represents protection, strength, and endurance.
            <br><br>
            In a broader philosophical sense, the Chakra Vyuha is a reminder of the impermanence of even the strongest defenses, as nothing remains invincible forever.
            <br><br>
            <h4>1.Cycle of Life and Warfare:</h4> Represents the continuous cycle of challenges, growth, and rebirth.
            The Chakra Vyuha is circular, emphasizing that life and war are cyclical, with each victory and defeat following one another in endless rotation. The formation’s layered structure represents the ongoing cycles of birth, growth, death, and rebirth, which are intrinsic to many Eastern philosophies.

            <h4>2.Unity and Cohesion:</h4> Each layer supports the others, showing strength in unity.
            The circular shape of the Chakra Vyuha embodies unity, cohesiveness, and the idea that strength arises from working together as a whole. The formation consists of multiple layers, each one supporting the other, which reflects the concept that in a strong defense, every unit (or person) has a role that contributes to a larger purpose.

            <h4>3.Strength with Vulnerability:</h4> Powerful yet not invincible, highlighting that even strong defenses have weaknesses.
            Although the Chakra Vyuha is one of the most potent and difficult formations to penetrate, it’s not invulnerable. Its design shows that while it is powerful and layered, it has a calculated weakness: the reliance on strong defenders at the core and progressively weaker defenses in the outer layers.

            <h4>4.Journey to the Core:</h4> The path to the center represents the pursuit of truth or deeper understanding.
            In the Chakra Vyuha, the goal for an enemy is to reach the center, which houses the strongest warriors and leaders. This symbolizes the idea that true power or understanding lies at the core, but to reach it, one must navigate through increasingly difficult challenges.

            <h4>5.Sacrifice and Bravery: </h4>Reflects the courage and selflessness needed to face overwhelming odds.
            The story of Abhimanyu entering the Chakra Vyuha and ultimately sacrificing his life is a testament to bravery and selflessness. His story highlights the role of sacrifice in the pursuit of a greater good and the heroism involved in facing overwhelming odds.
            The Chakra Vyuha, therefore, also symbolizes the warrior’s journey, filled with trials, and the willingness to make sacrifices for duty, principles, or to protect others.

            <h4>6.Psychological Warfare:</h4> Designed to intimidate and trap, symbolizing life's deceptive challenges.

            <h4>7.Leadership and Strategy:</h4> Demonstrates the need for strategic thinking, protection of core values, and readiness to adapt.

          <p class="answer-text">
            The Chakra Vyuha is an excellent example of leadership and strategic thinking in action. For any leader, it emphasizes the importance of positioning the right resources at the right layers of defense. The formation requires precise coordination, with each circle supporting the other, much like the roles in a well-organized team or company.
            <br><br>
            Leaders can learn to create flexible outer layers that adapt to changes or threats while safeguarding the core vision or mission of their organization.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <img src="content of chakravyuha imgs/mechanism of chakra vyuha.png" alt="mechanism of Chakra Vyuha" class="faq-image">
          <p class="answer-text">
            <h3> MATHEMATICS BEHIND IT:</h3>
            It is not known for sure, but it is believed that the chakrvyuh was some kind of a circle of proportion/oughtred's circle of proportion.
            <br><br>
            A circle of proportion is a slide rule which helps in calculating additions, substractions, divisions, multiplications, exponentials, logs and to some extent even trigonometry.
            It is made up of co-centric circles which are divided proportionately using arcs and tangents and the pieces rotate in unison to help us calculate.
            It was used as a calculator before modern computers were invented.
            It also found a lot of use in astronomy and sundials.
            <br><br>
            <h4> Now by using this mechanism, you can trap people inside.
            Also, precise mathematical calculations can be done to calculate how many radians each circle should rotate so that the person remains trapped.</h4>
            The manner in which this calculation is done is pretty simple. You rotate the two rows in-front and behind so that, no escape route comes up front or behind.

            As an example:
            Example: calculate sin(33°)
            <ul>
              <li>Move the cursor to 33 on the S scale.</li>
              <li>The cursor is at 5.45 on the C scale.</li>
              <li>We know that the correct answer for a sin in this range is between 0.1 and 1, so we adjust the decimal place to get 0.545.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            The attacker may break one of the outer rings and enter it, but it only makes things worse. As the ring keeps rotating; the place he breached to enter gets closed. So once you enter you are trapped inside.
            And in between the rings you have to face other warriors. So ultimately, you have no way in or out.
